            <p>To be truly successful, the salesperson 			    must be inspired to achieve a higher 			      	    calling. To believe that what they are selling is not simply easy or cool or convenient, but that it moves other people  to take action that will benefit them. </p>
            <p>When a Higher Sale's Founder Larry Coco experienced the tragic death of his daughter in 2002, he had to make the highest "sale" any one ever has to make: how to go on in life without his beloved child. To do so, Coco found the all-important inspiration: to "be Danielle’s legacy in this world.”</p>
